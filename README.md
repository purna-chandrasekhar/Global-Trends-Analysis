# Global-Trends-Analysis
### Problem Statement:
In a world shaped by complex population, health, and economic changes, understanding these trends is crucial for effective policy-making. GlobalTrends, a leading analytics firm, aims to unravel these patterns, using the Gapminder dataset to analyze global trends over time. The project uses Python EDA libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pyplot, and Seaborn to uncover relationships between demographic shifts, economic growth, and health progress.

### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** Leveraging **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis and **NumPy** for calculations.
- **Data Visualization:** Using **Seaborn and Matplotlib** to generate insightful visualizations of global trends.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Exploring the interplay between life expectancy, GDP, and population changes over time.

### Tool and Libraries Used:
-  Python
-  NumPy
-  Pandas
-  Matplotlib
-  Seaborn
-  RegEx

### Key Insights:
The analysis uncovers crucial patterns between economic and health metrics, helping to inform policy decisions by visualizing how changes in population and wealth have impacted health outcomes.
